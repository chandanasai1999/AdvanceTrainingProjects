    Validation of the User Login
-------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

Project objective:
-------------------------------------
Create a servlet-based web application that shows a login page and validates it. The correct values are hard-coded. On successful login, a dashboard page is shown. The dashboard will provide a link for logging out. Incorrect logins need to be handled by showing an error message page.

 

Background of the problem statement:
--------------------------------------------------
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to prototype a login scenario for the user. There is no database involved here, so you have to use fixed values for login email id and password.

 

You must use the following:
-------------------------------------------------
Eclipse as the IDE
Apache Tomcat as the web server
HTML pages for the front end
Servlets for backend processing
 

Following requirements should be met:
----------------------------------------------------
Show a login form in HTML
Handle invalid logins and show appropriate error messages using servlets
Show the dashboard page using servlets
Handle logouts using servlets
Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task


Example's Implementation Steps
As mentioned in the application description, the user will have to enter his username and password, so first of all, we need a JSP that asks the user to input his username and password in their corresponding fields.

To have this JSP, please follow these steps:

Open eclipse
Create a new "Dynamic Web Project"
Name it "LoginExample"
Create the JSP
In the "Web Content" folder, create a new JSP
Name it "LoginPage"
